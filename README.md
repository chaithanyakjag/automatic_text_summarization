# Automatic Text Summarization System
## Overview

This project focuses on developing an Automatic Text Summarization System to aid in summarizing daily news headlines for committee members who need to be well-informed for meetings. The system identifies the ten most important stories from the news headlines, saving significant time and effort in the news-reading process.

The summarization is performed using two different text processing libraries, NLTK and spaCy, both of which include powerful text preprocessing tools such as stop word removal, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and Named Entity Recognition (NER). Additionally, the project implements classification techniques using TF-IDF and LinearSVC, with the final summary generated using the TextRank algorithm.

## Methodology
### Part One: NLTK

1. Import required libraries such as Pandas, NLTK, and Scikit-learn.
2. Load the news headlines from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Preprocess text using NLTK's functions:
  - Remove stop words
  - Tokenize the text
  - Apply stemming and lemmatization
4. Perform Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the preprocessed text.
5. Classify the headlines using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer.
6. Generate a summary using the TextRank algorithm to extract the top 10 most important sentences.
7. Visualize the results using matplotlib.

### Part Two: spaCy and Scikit-learn

1. Use spaCy for text preprocessing, POS tagging, and NER.
2. Build a pipeline using TfidfVectorizer and LinearSVC from Scikit-learn for text classification.
3. Similar to NLTK, summarize the headlines using TextRank.
4. Compare the results from NLTK and spaCy side by side.

## Conclusion

After comparing the results from both NLTK and spaCy, the following observations can be made:

Both libraries are effective at summarizing text.
Depending on the specific use case, either library can be used for text summarization based on preference for preprocessing tools, accuracy, and speed.
In this project, the side-by-side comparison of the results is visualized to better understand the performance of each library.

## Visualization

The final output shows a side-by-side comparison of the summaries generated by NLTK and spaCy, highlighting the top 10 most important news stories from the day's headlines.
